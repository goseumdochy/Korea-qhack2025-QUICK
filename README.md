## üß© Problem Overview and Our Approach

### 1. QPE Implementation
We implemented the Quantum Phase Estimation algorithm for a simple 2x2 unitary matrix:
$U = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & e^{2\pi i \theta} \end{bmatrix}, \quad v = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$
Estimations were performed for:
- Œ∏ = 5/8
- Œ∏ = 3/7

We analyzed the accuracy as a function of the number of estimation qubits (see `qpe_analysis.ipynb`).

---

### 2. Estimating Eigenvalues of a Matrix
Given a non-positive-definite 4√ó4 Hermitian matrix, we estimated all eigenvalues **only** using QPE, without using any classical method to find eigenvectors. The unitary operator was constructed via matrix exponentiation:
$U = e^{2\pi i (I+\frac{M}{\text{norm}})/2}$
We provide its implementation in `problem2.ipynb`.

---

### 3. Noise Sensitivity Analysis
We analyzed QPE performance under:
- Depolarizing noise
- Amplitude damping
- Phase damping
- Readout error
- IBM Q fake real backend
- IBM Q real backend

Our findings (in `problem3_noise_final.ipynb`) highlight how noise models affect phase estimation accuracy.

### 4. QPE Application: MaxCut Ground Energy Estimation via QSVT
In this open-ended task, we explored a practical application of QPE:
- We prepared the **Gibbs state** using **Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT)**
- Then applied QPE to estimate the **ground energy** of a MaxCut Hamiltonian

This pipeline demonstrates how QPE can be integrated with advanced quantum techniques to solve combinatorial optimization problems. See:
- `problem4_QSVT_with_graph.ipynb`

We also performed detailed **noise analysis** on this full stack.
